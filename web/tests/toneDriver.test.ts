/**
 * The `.tone-*` contract.
 *
 * base.css declares six tone classes and each one does exactly one thing: set
 * the `--tone` custom property. A consumer opts in by reading `var(--tone)`.
 * That indirection is the whole point — it means the tone -> hue mapping is
 * written down once, so `bad` cannot be --err in one sheet and something else
 * in another.
 *
 * Both halves of the contract had drifted, which is why this file exists:
 *
 *   VOCABULARY — TS emitted ten tone names against a driver that knew five.
 *   `live` and `muted` set no variable at all, so consumers reading
 *   `var(--tone, …)` silently took a fallback (a `.tone-live` badge halo
 *   ringed in the cobalt ACTION; a `.tone-live` hollow dot in the critical
 *   red). The dashboard hid its own instance of the hole by painting --live
 *   directly on its selectors.
 *
 *   CONTRACT — eight sheets re-derived the mapping for themselves with rules
 *   like `.thing.tone-good { color: var(--ok) }`, and admin-v2-views.css went
 *   further and painted `color` for six tone names under a bare, unscoped
 *   selector. That leaked by source order, which forced two more rules whose
 *   only job was to shove other components back to their own ink.
 *
 * These tests fail on either regression.
