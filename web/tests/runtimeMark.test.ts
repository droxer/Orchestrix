 * The executor presence mark.
 *
 * The fleet card, the fleet row, and the computer page each drew [pip glyph]
 * for one executor on one computer, out of two implementations that had
 * already drifted: the admin sheet filled a healthy pip with `--ink-4` and
 * computer.css filled the same pip with `var(--tone)`, and computer.css reached
 * across to style a `.adm-agent-dot` child it did not own. Both bypassed
 * `StateMark`, so the filled/hollow rule was written three times in total.
