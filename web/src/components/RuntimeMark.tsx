/**
 * One executor on one computer: a presence pip beside the vendor glyph.
 *
 * This existed twice — `.adm-runtime-mark` on the fleet card and row, and
 * `.computer-runtime-row` on the computer page — and the copies had already
 * drifted: computer.css re-derived every presence rule against a
 * hand-drawn dot it borrowed from the admin stylesheet (since removed), and the two
 * disagreed on the healthy fill (`var(--tone)` versus `var(--ink-4)`). Both
 * also rolled their own filled/hollow rule instead of going through
 * `StateMark`, which is where that shape grammar is written down.
 *
 * The pip is a `StateMark` now, so shape comes from the one place: FILLED =
 * this runtime can take work right now, HOLLOW = it cannot. Hue then says why.
 * The presence → shape/hue rule itself lives in `lib/runtimePresence.ts`.
