/**
 * One group of a grouped list: a tinted band naming the group, then the rows
 * that belong to it.
 *
 * Every list view in the app groups, and each groups by the one dimension its
 * reader scans for — task status on the backlog, schedule health on routines,
 * fleet health on the admin employee and computer lists. That is what pays
 * for the columns the rows no longer have to carry: a row inside a band
 * labelled "Blocked" has already said it is blocked, so the per-row status
 * word is gone and the width it held went to the record's own facts.
 *
 * The band carries the group's accent (`--row-accent`), which the caller sets
 * either from a `data-*` attribute the stylesheet maps (tasks, routines) or
 * from the `tone` prop (admin, whose statuses are open-ended strings), so the
 * band tint, the mark inside it, and the rows below are one signal rather
 * than three that can drift.
