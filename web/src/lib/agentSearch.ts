 * Does this agent answer the roster's search box?
 *
 * The computer names are part of the haystack because the roster is banded by
 * computer: "what runs on the build box" is the question the rail is now shaped
 * to answer, and a search that could not reach a band name would empty the list
 * on the most obvious query the layout invites. Only ACTIVE placements count —
 * a torn-down computer has left the roster, so it must not keep matching.
 *
 * `blurb` is passed in rather than looked up: the per-runtime copy is
 * translated, and this module has no translator.
