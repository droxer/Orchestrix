"""give employees a handle of their own

`employees.id` is a UUID — uuid5 of the handle for anything created through the
admin form — so the admin surfaces rendered `@<uuid>` and the @handle grammar
had nothing behind it. The handle becomes its own column: the display and
lookup identity, while `id` stays the foreign key everywhere.

Backfill order per row: the linked login's username, then a slug of the display
name, then the first 8 characters of the id. Collisions get a numeric suffix,
because the column is unique.
