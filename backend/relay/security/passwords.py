"""The password policy, in one place.

Shaped after NIST SP 800-63B: length and a blocklist of guessable secrets do
the work, and composition rules (mixed case, a digit, a symbol) do not appear —
they push people toward `Password1!` while blocking passphrases that are
genuinely stronger.

Three things are checked beyond length:

* the common-password blocklist below,
* context-specific words — the account's own username, handle, display name and
  email are the first guesses anyone would make,
* degenerate shapes (one repeated character, a straight keyboard/alphabet run),
  which a blocklist can only cover one spelling at a time.

`web/src/lib/passwordPolicy.ts` mirrors every rule except the blocklist, so the
form can answer before a round trip; the backend stays the authority and is the
only side that has to be complete.
