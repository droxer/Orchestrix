"""How many times a task may be re-dispatched because it is not finished yet.

A round is one pass of a task's assignments. When the last round reports it is
unfinished, the task goes back to the queue for another one — bounded, because
an agent that always says "continue" would otherwise run until it exhausted the
account. The cap is resolved from two places: a per-task override when one is
pinned, the org-wide default otherwise, mirroring how personal-computer limits
resolve in `computer_limits`.
