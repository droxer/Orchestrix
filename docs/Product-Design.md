## 1. Executive Summary

| |
| :-: |
| Relay's core proposition: give every employee a long-term AI Partner that frees time from transactional work and redirects it toward customer value, business innovation, and organizational capability building. |

Relay is a next-generation Workforce Intelligence Platform for enterprises in the AI era. It is not a simple chatbot, enterprise knowledge base, or agent development platform. It provides an AI Partner that continuously learns, collaborates, and executes around real employee workflows.

Relay is designed to amplify employees, not replace them. It helps high-value employees reduce low-value transactional work, gives every employee access to expert-level support, and turns knowledge held by individuals into reusable organizational capability.

| Dimension | Content |
| :-: | :-: |
| One-line Definition | Relay gives every employee an AI Partner that connects organizational knowledge, business workflows, and professional capabilities so employees can create value faster. |
| Target Users | Sales, customer success, product managers, engineering, project managers, consultants, training teams, and managers. |
| Core Value | Improve employee productivity, increase knowledge reuse, capture expert experience, reduce collaboration friction, and increase customer value creation. |
| Initial Entry Scenarios | Sales value creation, product and engineering collaboration, customer success operations, organizational knowledge assistance, and expert experience capture. |
| Long-term Vision | Evolve from Personal Relay to Team Relay and Organization Relay, forming an enterprise organizational intelligence network. |

### 1.1 Document Boundary

This product plan answers:

- Who Relay serves.
- Which pain points Relay prioritizes.
- Which scenarios create early business value.
- Which capabilities make the product differentiated.
- How Relay should enter the market and expand.
- Which product risks must be controlled.

This product plan does not define service topology, database schema, sandbox implementation, workflow APIs, or infrastructure deployment. Those decisions belong in the architecture and technical implementation documents.

## 2. Product Background and Market Opportunity

### 2.1 Enterprise Workforces Are Changing in the AI Era

Historically, enterprise digitization focused on moving processes into systems: CRM managed customers, ERP managed operations, OA managed approvals, LMS managed training, and wikis managed knowledge. These systems still depend on employees to enter data, search for information, and coordinate work manually.

AI agents create the first real opportunity to turn information inside systems into executable work capability. Employees should no longer need to switch constantly across systems. Instead, they can work through an AI Partner that understands the business, carries the right context, respects permission boundaries, and helps with information retrieval, task coordination, content generation, and process follow-up.

| |
| :-: |
| Enterprises buy Relay not because they want "agents," but because they want employees to create more value in the same amount of time. |

### 2.2 Gaps in Existing Enterprise AI Tools

| Existing Category | Primary Capability | Limitation | Relay Entry Point |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| General LLMs / ChatGPT-like tools | Q&A, writing, analysis | Lack enterprise context, permissions, long-term memory, and task closure | Build long-term AI Partners around employee roles and business scenarios |
| Copilot-style tools | Improve productivity inside office applications | Mostly focused on documents, email, and meetings; weak cross-system execution | Connect knowledge, workflows, tools, and collaborators |
| Enterprise knowledge bases / RAG | Query documents and policies | Answer questions but rarely move work forward | Upgrade from "knowing" to "executing and capturing" |
| Agent development platforms | Build tool calls and automation flows | Technical-platform oriented; business users struggle to see direct value | Deliver product value through frequent, high-ROI business scenarios |

### 2.3 The Enterprise Pain Is Not Tool Shortage, but Low-Value Work Consuming High-Value Employees

Most knowledge workers do not spend most of their time creating value. Their work is fragmented by transactional tasks: looking up information, writing summaries, sending emails, syncing progress, chasing follow-ups, entering system data, and preparing reports. Relay's opportunity is to shift this work to an AI Partner so employees can return to work that directly creates value.

## 3. Relay Product Positioning

| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Recommended | Generate emails, summarize meetings, analyze customer risk | Can be generated directly and used after employee confirmation |
| Low-risk Execution | Update non-critical fields, create tasks, organize materials | Can execute automatically after authorization, with audit records retained |
| High-risk Execution | Send official quotes, approve contracts, delete data, make external commitments | Requires human approval |

## 7. Differentiation and Competitive Strategy

### 7.1 Relay's Core Differentiation

Relay's differentiation is not "how many agents it has," but whether it can connect employee work, organizational knowledge, and value creation into a closed loop.

| Dimension | Ordinary AI Assistant | Agent Development Platform | Relay |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Starting Point | Answer questions | Build automated agents | Employee value creation |
| Users | Individual or office users | Developers / technical teams | Business employees, team managers, enterprise leaders |
| Core Result | Content generation | Tool calls | Work completion, knowledge capture, experience reuse |
| Context | Short-term conversation | Task context | Long-term employee context + organizational context |
| Organizational Value | Limited | Depends on development capability | Builds organizational intelligence |

### 7.2 Avoid the "Employee Replacement" Narrative

Relay's brand and sales narrative should avoid words such as layoff, replacement, or digital employees replacing people. The correct narrative is that Relay helps employees become Super Employees, enabling the same teams to produce higher-quality, faster, and more customer-valuable outcomes.

- For employees: Relay is a work partner, not a competitor.
- For managers: Relay is a team accelerator, not a surveillance tool.
- For enterprises: Relay is organizational intelligence infrastructure, not a point productivity tool.

## 8. Business Value and ROI Model

### 8.1 Value Creation Model

| Value Dimension | Measurement | Example |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Time Released | Hours of transactional work saved per employee per week | Sales post-meeting entry and follow-up reduced by 3 hours per week |
| Revenue Increase | Changes in sales conversion, renewal rate, and expansion rate | Customer success identifies renewal risks earlier |
| Innovation Speed | Cycle time from requirement discovery to delivery | Product requirement analysis and documentation cycle shortened |
| Knowledge Reuse | Reuse count for historical cases, templates, and decision records | Consultants reuse historical delivery plans |
| New Employee Ramp-up | Time to independent productivity | New sales ramp-up shortened from 3 months to 6 weeks |

### 8.2 ROI Example

Assume a 1,000-person knowledge-work enterprise initially covers 300 sales, product, customer success, and project management employees. If each person saves 3 hours of transactional work per week, and 50% of that time converts into high-value activities such as customer communication, solution improvement, and product innovation, Relay releases 900 hours per week, with 450 hours redirected into value creation.

| Dimension | Content |
| :-: | :-: |
| Covered Employees | 300 |
| Time Saved per Employee per Week | 3 hours |
| Total Time Released per Week | 900 hours |
| Converted to High-value Work | Approximately 450 hours |
| Additional Gains | More sales opportunities, earlier renewal risk handling, faster product delivery, increased knowledge reuse |

### 8.3 Executive Metrics

- Higher share of employee time spent on high-value work.
- Shorter cross-functional collaboration cycles.
- Improved sales conversion, renewal rate, and customer satisfaction.
- Lower knowledge search time and fewer repeated questions.
- Shorter new employee ramp-up cycles.
- Higher rate of expert experience converted into assets.

| Employee Resistance | Employees worry about replacement or monitoring | Emphasize employee amplification in positioning; provide data transparency and employee-controlled authorization |
| Permission Risk | Agent misoperation or unauthorized access | Three-layer permissions: employee permission, agent permission, task permission; audit trail |
| Hallucination and Error | Incorrect information or recommendations | Require sources, confidence signals, and human confirmation for critical tasks |
| Data Security | Sensitive data leakage | Tenant isolation, private deployment, masking, access control |
| Tool Execution Risk | External sending, approvals, deletions, and other high-risk actions | Human-in-the-loop and approval policies |
| Invisible Value | Customers cannot see time saved or value created | Built-in ROI dashboard and scenario metrics |

## 12. Conclusion

Relay's opportunity is not to build yet another agent platform. It is to redefine how employees and organizations work in the AI era.

The valuable product narrative is not "every employee gets a digital worker." It is "every employee gets an AI Partner that helps them become more focused, more efficient, and more creative."

Relay should enter through high-value, frequent, measurable business scenarios, first helping sales, product, customer success, engineering, and professional services teams increase value creation. As data, memory, collaboration, and experience capture accumulate, Relay will evolve from an individual productivity tool into enterprise organizational intelligence infrastructure.

| |
| :-: |
| Final Positioning: Relay is an AI Workforce Intelligence Platform that helps enterprises maximize employee productivity and value creation. |
